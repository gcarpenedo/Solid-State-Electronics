# MATLAB Projects – Solid State Electronics

This repository contains **MATLAB scripts and functions** developed for the **Solid State Electronics** course.  
The files are organized into four folders, each corresponding to a specific topic in the course.

## Contents

- `1_Schrodinger_1D` – Numerical solution of the 1D Schrödinger equation  
- `2_NonStationary_States` – Simulation of non-stationary quantum states  
- `3_Band_Theory` – Exercises and scripts related to band theory in solids  
- `4_Carrier_Statistics` – Analysis and simulation of carrier statistics
