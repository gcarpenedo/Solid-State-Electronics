# MATLAB Projects – Solid State Electronics

This repository contains **MATLAB scripts and functions** developed for the **Solid State Electronics** course.  
The files are organized into four folders, each corresponding to a specific topic in the course.

## Contents

- `Lab_1` – Numerical solution of the 1D Schrödinger equation  
- `Lab_2` – Simulation of non-stationary quantum states  
- `Lab_3` – Exercises and scripts related to band theory in solids  
- `Lab_4` – Analysis and simulation of carrier statistics
